## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️
**Do not even consider using this in production.**

This project contains way to much vulnerabilities that I will not resolve.

Why you might say ?

Because this project was realised for the course Internet Technologies (ELKRB16822) at VILNIUS TECH in 2023.

## How to use
1. Have `docker` installed on your system
2. Configure `docker-compose.yml`
3. Run `./setup.sh` (you should always read a shell script before executing it)
5. Go to `<your website>/setup.php`
