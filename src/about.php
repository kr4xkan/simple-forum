    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>
        <b><?php echo site_title() ?></b> is a website for my a course work project in VILNIUS TECH! This website has been developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.
        <br><br>
        This project is focused on making a dynamic website using various web technologies. I have spent a lot of time researching and gathering data to support my ideas. I have also worked hard to develop creative solutions to the challenges I faced along the way.
        <br><br>
        On this website, you will find fictive forum posts and users. They do not represent anyone and are only here to demonstrate the capability of the platform.
        <br><br>
        The whole platform has been written from scratch by myself (<a href="https://krax.fr" target="_blank">checkout my other projects</a>). It is not perfect, far from that, there might still be SQL Injectable fields or other vulnerabilities such as XSS. Do not use this project code for any production website.
